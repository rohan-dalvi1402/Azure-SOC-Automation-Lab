# Azure-SOC-Automation-Lab

I built a small home SOC on Azure to study real-world brute-force attacks in real time. The setup involved exposing a Windows VM to the internet (a deliberate honeypot), streaming Windows Security logs into Microsoft Sentinel. Using KQL, I analyzed failed RDP login attempts, enriched attacker IPs with geolocation data and created a live attack map to visualize adversary activity in real time. Hereâ€™s how I did it step by step.

## Objective

The goal was to gain hands-on experience in SIEM operations and threat detection by simulating real-world attack scenarios. The lab focused on collecting and analyzing Windows security logs, detecting failed RDP login attempts, enriching data with geolocation context and visualizing attack patterns through Sentinel workbooks.

### Skills Learned

- Practical deployment and configuration of Microsoft Sentinel in a cloud environment.

- Log ingestion, parsing and analysis using KQL (Kusto Query Language).

- Monitoring and detection of brute-force attack attempts against exposed endpoints.

- Building custom visualizations and workbooks to track attacker activity globally.

### What You Need

- Azure subscription (free for new signers)
- A small Windows VM (Windows 10 or Server 2022)
- Microsoft Sentinel + Log Analytics workspace
- A GeoIP CSV imported as a Sentinel watchlist

### 1. Create Resource Group and Virtual Network

A dedicated resource group and virtual network were created to host the SOC lab. Throughout the process, the Azure subscription, resource group and region must be consistent.

The VNet was configured with the address space 10.0.0.0/16 and a default subnet of 10.0.0.0/24.

### 2. Deploy Windows VM (Honeypot)

A Windows VM was deployed and deliberately exposed to the internet as a honeypot. The Windows firewall was disabled.

The Network Security Group (NSG) was configured with an inbound rule allowing RDP (port 3389) from any source. This setup was crucial to attract brute-force login attempts from external actors.

### 3. Connect Microsoft Sentinel

Enabled Microsoft Sentinel on a Log Analytics workspace and connected Windows Security events from the VM for ingestion.

### 4. Query with KQL

Used KQL to filter failed RDP login attempts (Event ID 4625) and extract attacker IP addresses from logs.

```kusto
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4625
| project TimeGenerated, Account, Computer, EventID, Activity, IPAddress
```

### 5. Enrich with Geolocation (Watchlist)

Uploaded a watchlist mapping IPs to geolocation data and joined it with failed login events for enrichment.

```kusto
let GeoIPDB_FULL = _GetWatchlist("geoip");
let WindowsEvents = SecurityEvent
    | where IpAddress == <attacker IP address>
    | where EventID == 4625
    | order by TimeGenerated desc
    | evaluate ipv4_lookup(GeoIPDB_FULL, IpAddress, network);
WindowsEvents
```

### 6. Build Attack Map Visualization

Finally, I created a Sentinel Workbook and used the geolocation data to display a world map of attacker IPs.

## Results

Within just 30 minutes, I saw multiple login attempts from across the globe. Leaving the VM up for 24 hours gave me thousands more hits! A live feed of brute-force attacks against my honeypot.
